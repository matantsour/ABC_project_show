<p style="text-align: left;">I'm an student, studying the <strong>Industrial Engineering Field</strong>, specializes in<strong> Data Analysis</strong> and <strong>Information Systems</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Followed by those links, you can access the<strong> first&nbsp;project</strong> i've ever made in the world of<strong> Data-Analysis&nbsp;and Data-Visualization.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of course, this project was not made&nbsp;only&nbsp;by&nbsp;me, I want to thank my friend Asaf Krentzler &lt;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/asaf-krenzler-294b7319b" target="_blank">Asaf's_LinkedIn</a>&gt; for his participation in this amazing creation&nbsp;of ours.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>&nbsp;Main&nbsp;Parts:</h2>
<p>*the links will be opened in a new window</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aquiring a data-set:<br /></span></h3>
<br />We chose <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows" target="_blank">Netflix-Shows-Kaggle.com</a>&nbsp;as our data-set.<br />You can download the excel file from here: <a href="https://github.com/matantsour/ABC_project_show/blob/gh-pages/netflix_titles.xlsx?raw=true" target="_blank">Netflix2019</a><br />This is first step in the way, and one of the most important steps .&nbsp;<br />We needed to choose carefully the data sets, those were <strong>some&nbsp; of&nbsp;our requirements:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Enough float-type related columns</li>
<li>Some&nbsp;empty cells and missing data</li>
<li>Date related colums</li>
<li>The data-set is divided into types of objects. in this case: TV-Shows and Movies. which are represented differently</li>
<li>There are multi-valued cells. cells which are composed of several values. we needed to divided those.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cleaning and Exploring the data:<br /></span></h3>
<br />This is the long part, full of creativity and imagination.<br />It envolved manipulating the data, and really asking questions we were interested in getting their answers.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such questions might have been:
<ul>
<li>top 15 most common countries in Movies.</li>
<li>what is the percentage of movie releases in each month according to all movies in netflix.</li>
<li>Minimun age to watch a title, by "Rating" classification.</li>
<li>The quantity of titles added for each month, seperated by the Mininum Age factor.</li>
<li>Displaying the categories popularity over the year within a HeatMap.</li>
<li>Displaying the distribution of Total Cast over the different types of categories in a Box Plot.</li>
<li>Answering statistical questions , and verifyng hypothesis.</li>
<li>And More<br /><br /></li>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data-splitting and preperation for DB Structure:<br /></span></h3>
<br />By This Time, we've had a lot going on on our data, and we probably could have gone even deeper if it was&nbsp;necessary.<br />We decided to split the data-sets into different tables for later use in&nbsp;Microsoft MySql platform.<br />The best way was to revolve the data around the "Show-id" Field as the primary key to most tables.&nbsp;<br />those were some of the tables we built:<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Show_Id_Type</li>
<li>Show_Id_Title</li>
<li>Show_Id_Category</li>
<li>Show_Id_Duration</li>
<li>Show_Id_Age_Limitation</li>
<li>Show_Id_Country</li>
<li>Countris_Count</li>
<li>Years_Count_2000</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Working With MySql- applying the data into DB and Creating DB Diagram:<br /></span></h3>
<br />For the big Finale, we took those tables and imported them into Microsoft MySql platform in order to make queries easier, <br />to save Views and defining Stored Procedures.<br />Attached by is a .pdf presenting some screenshots&nbsp;of some of the things we did and also the&nbsp;<strong>DB ERD DIAGRAM</strong><br /><br />&lt;link to pdf&gt;<br /><br /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>We've applied a lot of new&nbsp;features and knowledge during the actual work through research and exploration of our joint abilities.</p>
